                    <h1>Our Accreditations</h1>


                    Internal Medicine & Primary Care has been recognized as a Patient Centered Medical Home by the National Committee of Quality Assurance. We are also a Blue Cross Blue Shield Blue Quality designated physician’s program (BQPP), which means we’re constantly working to provide our patients with high-quality care and more positive outcomes at a lower cost.<br><br> It is our hope that these accreditations will help our practice build stronger relationships, and allow us to work together with our patients to provide quality care that will best serve their needs.<br><br><br>
