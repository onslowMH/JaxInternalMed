<p>Dr. Sequia Holland-Ellis is a board-certified family medicine physician with a specialty in obstetrics and gynecology. With close to ten years of experience, Dr. Holland-Ellis has found her passion in women’s health with a focus on a subset of women she refers to as the “forgotten women.” These are women who go years without medical care—those that are no longer having children but are often too young to suffer from chronic conditions that require follow-up. It is her goal to be a compassionate, listening ear and skilled care provider for these women.
</p>
        <p>Dr. Holland-Ellis also has a long-standing commitment to service for her country—she was commissioned as an officer in the United States Navy in May 2009 and served until June 2018. Outside of family medicine, Dr. Holland-Ellis and her husband Daryl are kept busy raising their four children and three fur babies.
