<h3>Appointment Information</h3>

<h3>New Patient info</h3>
<p>New patients need to bring all their medications and their insurance cards. Please plan to arrive at least 15 minutes early for your appointment.</p>

<h3>Follow-up Visits</h3>
<p>Please arrive 10 minutes prior to appointment. Please bring to any visit all of your medications, or a detailed list of your medications containing strengths and dosages, to ensure we care for you in the safest manner possible. Please bring your insurance card to every visit as well.  This ensures that you receive all of your insurance benefits by allowing us to have your correct insurance information in our system when we submit claims.</p>

<h3>Cell Phone Policy</h3>
<p>Please do your best to silence your cell phones upon entering our practice to better serve you and our patients.</p>

<h3>Insurance Policies Accepted</h3>
<p>Always check with your insurance company before selecting a physician.</p>
<p>We accept the following insurance plans: most private insurance (e.g. Blue Cross Blue Shield, United Health Care, Medcost) Medicare and Medicaid.</p>

<h3>Billing</h3>
<p>All insurance co-payments and deductibles are due at the time of service.</p>

<h3>Referrals</h3>
<p>Should it become necessary for us to refer you to a specialist, or order a procedure or diagnostic test as part of your care, we will contact your insurance company, verify the requirements of your plan and obtain the necessary authorizations for your referral. Please allow 48 hours from the time you see us to process the proper authorization. After the proper authorizations are secured from the insurance company, we will happily assist you with scheduling your appointment. We cannot obtain "retro" authorizations for coverage unless the care provided was the result of hospitalization or the need was emergent. Some insurance plans and specialists do not require primary care involvement to schedule an appointment.</p>
